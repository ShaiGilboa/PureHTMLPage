### Inspired by GitHub's new special profile Repo
<p bgcolor="red" color="green">
When I started working on the <font face="Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif" color="red" size="3">special profile repo option</font> that GitHub added, I tried styling it. <br />
As many might know, GitHub does not allow CSS in the Markdown files, and because the README is a <em>README.md</em> the only way to style it is with old school html styling. <br />
So, I took the day to review what I have learned, and learn what I did not know, and came up with this <strong>"Pure HTML Page"</strong>.
