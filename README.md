# PureHTMLPage
building a page in pure HTML5

### Inspired by GitHub's new special profile Repo
When I started working on the special profile repo option that GitHub added, I tried styling it. <br />
As many might know, GitHub does not allow CSS in the Markdown files, and because the README is a _README.md_ the only way to style it is with old school html styling. <br />
So, I took the day to review what I have learned, and learn what I did not know, and came up with this *"Pure HTML Page"*.

Enjoy :)
